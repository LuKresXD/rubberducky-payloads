# Payload Repository ðŸ’»

This project is an Internal Assignment on computer science.

## Description
The Payload Repository is a web application designed to provide various scripts for system penetration testing and security assessments. These scripts enable users to perform actions such as setting up backdoors, grabbing IP information, and stealing passwords. Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, this application is an essential tool for security professionals and enthusiasts.

## Features
- **WinRM Backdoor**: Sets up a backdoor on Windows by reporting the device's IP to a Discord webhook, creating a hidden admin user, enabling WinRM, modifying firewall rules, and disabling UAC remote restrictions.
- **IP Grabber**: Reports the IP address, hostname, and username of a Windows system to a Discord webhook using PowerShell commands.
- **Password Stealer**: Gains unauthorized remote access to a Windows system by disabling security measures, extracting data, and uploading it to a Discord webhook.
- **Telegram Data Stealer**: Steals Telegram user data from macOS and Windows systems, including App Store and Tdata versions.
